        title: 'Front-End web developing with React',
        description: 'This course explores Javascript based front-end application development, and in particular the React library (Currently Ver. 16.3). This course will use JavaScript ES6 for developing React application. You will also get an introduction to the use of Reactstrap for Bootstrap 4-based responsive UI design. You will be introduced to various aspects of React components. You will learn about React router and its use in developing single-page applications. You will also learn about designing controlled forms. You will be introduced to the Flux architecture and Redux. You will explore various aspects of Redux and use it to develop React-Redux powered applications. You will then learn to use Fetch for client-server communication and the use of REST API on the server side. A quick tour through React animation support and testing rounds off the course.',

        description: 'This course builds upon the skills and coding practices learned in both Principles of Secure Coding and Identifying Security Vulnerabilities, courses one and two, in this specialization.  This course uses the focusing technique that asks you to think about:  “what to watch out for” and “where to look” to evaluate and ultimately remediate fragile C++ library code.',

        title: 'Identifying Security Vulnerabilities',
        description: 'This course will help you build a foundation of some of the fundamental concepts in secure programming. We will learn about the concepts of threat modeling and cryptography and you will be able to start to create threat models, and think critically about the threat models created by other people. We will learn the basics of applying cryptography, such as encryption and secure hashing. We will learn how attackers can exploit application vulnerabilities through the improper handling user-controlled data. We will gain a fundamental understanding of injection problems in web applications, including the three most common types of injection problems: SQL injection, cross-site scripting, and command injection. We will also cover application authentication and session management where authentication is a major component of a secure web application and session management is the other side of the same coin, since the authenticated state of user requests need to be properly handled and run as one session. We will learn about sensitive data exposure issues and how you can help protect your customers data. We will cover how to effectively store password-related information, and not to store the actual plaintext passwords.',
